# TODO list API

1. Please create a server application with the API documented below
    - Feel free to use a web framework of your choice in Python - Django is prefferred, but a micro-framework such as Flask is also a good choice
    - Try to write a clean and well designed code for me to inspect
    - Specify a guide to run the server app in README 
    - The Server App doesn't need to have a persistent data storage, you can just store the data in-memory or whatever you prefer

2. Design an API change to make it possible to create a nested list of subtasks for every task (even for subtasks)
    - update the documentation below and add it to the project source as `api-doc.md`
    - also update the application to support subtasks


### Instalation
Run the project with docker using ``docker-compose`` (preferred) or ``python main.py``

#### About
Created using micro framework Flask as a entry task.
